What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any?
    I did not encounter any main challenges with this assignment, it was pretty straightforward. 

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
    The requirements specification for this assignment is clear and well-structured, though it does have some ambiguity 
    of whether or not we should make our program bug free or not in order to test the testing framework. There is also multiple 
    ways to do tests with these framework, for example in pytest we can do assert of parameterized testing and it was unclear which 
    one to use. 

What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
    Originally I had overlooked some of the edge cases such as if the triangle was invalid or had sidelengths equal to zero. 
    I was able to use pytest without errors but am unsure if I am testings for all possibilities that I should be. 

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
    The criteria I used was making sure that I had tested triangles of each type (equilateral, isolceles, scalene) and right, 
    as well as the invalid scenarios I accounted for in the code.
